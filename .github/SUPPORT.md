# üÜò Support

Looking for help with the GitHub Reusable Workflows project? This guide explains where to find information and how to reach the maintainers.

## Start with the Docs

Please review the existing documentation before opening a request:

- [README](../README.md) ‚Äì overview of available workflows and usage examples
- [Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) ‚Äì how to propose changes
- [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) ‚Äì community expectations
- [Security Policy](./SECURITY.md) ‚Äì how to report sensitive issues

## Ask a Question

Use GitHub Discussions for general questions, design ideas, or implementation advice:

- [Open a new discussion](../../discussions/new)
- Tag your discussion with `question` or `idea` for quicker triage

## Report a Problem

If you encounter an issue with a workflow or composite action:

1. Search [existing issues](../../issues) to avoid duplicates.
2. If the problem is new, open a ticket using the appropriate template at [New Issue](../../issues/new/choose).
3. Include the workflow file you were running, the inputs used, and a link to the failing run if possible.

## Request Enhancements

Feature ideas are welcome. Suggest them via:

- [GitHub Discussions](../../discussions) if you want to brainstorm first
- [GitHub Issues](../../issues/new/choose) for concrete proposals (our ‚Äútask‚Äù and ‚Äúuser story‚Äù templates work well for workflow requests)

Please describe the problem you are trying to solve, how the new workflow or step would help, and any constraints we should consider.

## Response Times

Target response windows (best effort):

- Security reports: within **48 hours**
- Critical workflow breakages: within **2 business days**
- Feature requests and questions: within **1 week**

## Private Support

For confidential matters (for example, potential security vulnerabilities or sensitive log data) contact [@mtnvencenzo](https://github.com/mtnvencenzo).
